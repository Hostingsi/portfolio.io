                        <p>Perhaps the most known role of HR is keeping track of documents, including employee
                             records related to attendance, vacations, medical leave, and other employee data.
                              This helps demonstrate that the company complies with labor regulations about
                               working hours and conditions. It also helps ensure that employees receive the 
                               correct salary and benefits based on their employment status, hours worked, 
                               and pay rates.

                            As a human resources professional, you support employees by providing continuing
                             education, training, and support for health and wellbeing. Adequate
                              human resources are key to maintaining employee satisfaction and morale. 
                              The way HR supports employees may vary from one company to another. Here are 
                              some ways your HR department can provide support to employees.

                            HR may oversee continuing education programs that benefit both the employer
                             and employee.  This may be professional development, tuition reimbursement 
                             for courses, or certifications. Giving employees opportunities to enhance 
                             their skill sets and industry knowledge can boost morale and incentivize 
                             workers to continue working for the company. Education assistance programs 
                             often work well as recruitment and retention tools.
