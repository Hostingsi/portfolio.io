                        <p>
                            Recruitment includes all aspects of hiring, from sourcing candidates to onboarding.
                             You may work with hiring managers to determine the needs of a particular role and
                              then find candidates that meet those requirements. You will typically use job 
                              boards, career websites, social media, employee referrals, and more to find potential
                               candidates. You may interview HR candidates or alongside department managers to 
                               assess whether the applicants are a good fit for the position. After choosing a 
                               candidate, you’ll work with them through the onboarding process. This includes 
                               collecting payroll and benefits administration paperwork, such as W-4s, I-9s, direct
                                deposit forms, and any other documents your company needs. In addition, you may 
                                prepare new hire materials, such as orientation packets or company handbooks 
                                outlining company policies.
                                                       
                        </p>

                        <h2>Training and developmentt</h2><br>
                        <p>                          
                            Training and development ensure that employees are updated on their skills 
                            and improve their job performance. Whether you develop the training in-house 
                            or contract with another group, it’s essential to establish an inventory of 
                            what training and development opportunities are available within your company.
                             This also can include outside sources that can provide the information and
                              skills employees need. When developing a training program, you’ll consider
                               mandatory and voluntary opportunities. The law may require some training, 
                               such as sexual harassment education. Other training may be geared toward 
                               individual career goals or the company’s needs. Your ultimate goal is to 
                               ensure that all employees have access to the tools they need to succeed 
                               and become more valuable to the company.
